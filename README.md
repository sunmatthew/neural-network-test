### neural-network-tests
Basically just some tests that I made by following some tutorials and stuff online. There are two test files: `test.py` and `test2.py`.

These are pretty useless on their own, but ill probably use them for reference when I start on some other projects.

##### test.py
Uses numpy for a quick test of a 3 layer feedforward neural network. Kinda boring, but can be used to predict the next number in a series (potential project idea???).

##### test2.py
Uses numpy and tensorflow to predict the line of best fit given a set of 100 data points. Uses the gradient descent method.
